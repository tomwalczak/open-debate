Write a self-contained analysis (MAX 600 WORDS) that maps the argument landscape. Someone who didn't watch the debate should be able to follow. The reader needs clarity on the strongest arguments, where the fault lines lie, and what they should investigate further.

Cover:
- Strongest arguments: What were the most compelling arguments made? Be specific about the actual claims and reasoning.
- Load-bearing claims: What are the core propositions each side depends on? State them as clear, falsifiable claims.
- Key tensions: Where do the two sides fundamentally disagree? What would resolve the disagreement?
- Blindspots and gaps: What did neither side address? What assumptions went unchallenged?
- Patterns: Did certain argument types dominate? Were there recurring weaknesses?
- Further investigation: What specific questions should the reader research before their debate?

FORMATTING:
- Write in propositional full sentences. State claims directly.
- No markdown (no **, no ##, no bullet points)
- Plain prose paragraphs with line breaks between sections
- Be specific and analytical, not generic

Use "${speaker1Name}" and "${speaker2Name}" as names throughout.`,
